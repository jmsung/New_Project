This file should include
1) Where the data come from,

2) What scripts under the scripts/ directory transformed which files under raw/ 
into which files under processed/ and cleaned/, and

3) Why each file under cleaned/ exists, with optional references to particular notebooks. 
(Optional, especially when things are still in flux.)
