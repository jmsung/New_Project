# New_Project

This template is adapted from (ericmjl/ds-project-organization.md
) for "How to organize your Python data science project"

Let’s start with the most front-facing file in your repository, the README file. 
It should contain information that will help your forgetful future self, newcomers, 
and collaborators figure out why this project exists, how things are organized, 
conventions used in the project, and where they can go to find more information.

Note here that the why portion is the most important. It gives the necessary 
context for the reader of your README file. Think of it as documentation that 
you leave behind, so you don’t have to sit down and explain over and over 
the high-level overview of the project.
